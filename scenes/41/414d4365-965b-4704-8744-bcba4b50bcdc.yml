  \ Bacon\n\nSCENE OPENS on a close-up of a leaf, crisp and perfect. We slowly pan\
  \ up to reveal a slightly disheveled looking man (Michael Vegas), his back turned\
  \ to us. He holds a rabbit, which he has clearly just caught. He looks around, scanning\
  \ the area. The woods are utterly silent. As he looks around, a gust of wind moves\
  \ the trees. Satisfied that his scan has yielded nothing, he walks away.\n\nWe follow\
  \ him as he walks through the woods, finally arriving at a makeshift camp. Tarps\
  \ are strung over poles in a haphazardly manner.  An old fire lingers in front.\n\
  \nAs he begins to prepare the rabbit, he is suddenly roused when he senses something.\
  \ Following his senses, he walks back through the woods until he comes upon a nearby\
  \ cabin. \n\nHidden in the brush, he watches as a car pulls up and two women get\
  \ out, Luna (Emily Willis) and Gwen (Emma Hix). They are here for a weekend getaway\
  \ that Luna booked. Gwen is nervous because she's not used to the isolation of the\
  \ country.\n\nAs they are about to enter the house, Gwen seems to sense something.\
  \ She turns around and looks back at the woods. The trees blow in the wind, but\
  \ she sees nothing.\n\nCUT TO TITLE\n\nA short time later, the girls are sunning\
  \ themselves on the dock. They chat about their new friendship, discussing the fact\
  \ that Gwen has recently gotten out of a relationship. Luna planned the weekend\
  \ away as a destresser for Gwen.\n\nThe girls apply suntan lotion to each other,\
  \ their hands rubbing their glistening bodies as the man watches, unbeknownst to\
  \ them. \n\nLater that night, the girls watch a movie as the man peers in from outside\
  \ through a window. Soon, the weather turns stormy and the power goes out. As lightning\
  \ periodically illuminates the darkened cabin, Luna reveals that she is sensing\
  \ a subtle romantic vibe from Gwen. After some initial reluctance from Gwen, since\
  \ she has never been with a woman before, they share a tender moment and kiss. \n\
  \nThey have sex, with Luna patiently leading the shy and inexperienced Gwen through\
  \ her first lesbian experience. As they fuck, lightning continues to flash.\n\n\
  Midway through the sex, the girls are lost in each other, both of their eyes closed.\
  \ Lightning flashes. In that split second, we see that the man stands directly over\
  \ them. The room is then plunged back into darkness.\n\nThe man has something special\
  \ planned for the girls, but not everything is as it seems.."
